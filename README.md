An ant is sitting on a grid of white and black squares. Initially the grid is all white and the ant faces right.  At each step it does the following:
At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward one unit.

At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counterclockwise), and move forward one unit.
